## General Plan
### Problem to Solve: 
Organizing volunteering events can be a handful, you need to reach out and access a lot of different technologies to make it work and get the word out.

### Our Solution:
We are creating a web application that would allow volunteer organizations to create pages and post events to their page, along with the use of a dashboard to keep track of those events and volunteers. Volunteers would also be able to create accounts and then be free to sign up and join various organizations to follow when they create events, or search for events that they want to volunteer for just in general.


### Target Audience:
- Charity Organizations that host events that require volunteers
- People who want to volunteer and make a difference in their community.

### MVP Scope
- Sign up flow: Volunteers
- Volunteers have a home page with a calendar where their upcoming events and other events from organizations they are following are shown.
- Volunteers can navigate to and edit their user profile
- Volunteers can search for and join organizations
- Volunteers can volunteer for events.
- Events will be seeded in the Back End

### Stretch Goals
1. Sign up flow: Organizations
2. Organizations have a home dashboard that will display summaries such as upcoming events and numbers of volunteers for them.
3. Organizations have an organization page that would be what users see when they navigate to that organization.
4. Organizations can edit their organization page.
5. Organizations can create and edit events.
6. Organizations can send notifications to groups of volunteers using [Messege Bird API](https://messagebird.com/en/).
7. Organizations can validate users after events have occurred. IE give them a badge or a glowing review or something.
8. Orgs can search for users to ask to volunteer based on volunteer interests and reviews(?)
